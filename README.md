# Overview

<h2>Purpose</h2>

The purpose of this project is to gain understanding of REST API for managing student records, enabling efficient creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of student data in a structured manner using `Postman` for testing and documentation.


<h2>Features</h2>

- **Create**: Add new student records with details such as StudentID, GivenName, LastName, and EmailAddress.
- **Read**: Retrieve individual student details or a list of all students.
- **Update**: Modify existing student records using their unique identifiers.
- **Delete**: Remove student records based on specific criteria like StudentID and GivenName.
- **Validation**: Ensure data integrity with validation rules for input fields.
- **Error Handling**: Provide meaningful error messages for validation failures and other exceptions.
- **Authentication**: Secure API endpoints with token-based authentication.
- **Postman Integration**: Use Postman for testing API endpoints and ensuring correct functionality.
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for all endpoints, including examples of requests and responses.



<h2>Debugging Process</h2>

### 1. Check Request and Response

- **Inspect Request Data**: Ensure that the data being sent to the API is correctly formatted and includes all required fields.
- **Review Response**: Look at the API response to understand the status code and any error messages returned by the server.

### 2. Validate Input Data

- **Validation Rules**: Verify that the input data adheres to the defined validation rules. For example, check that `StudentID` is unique and `EmailAddress` is a valid email format.
- **Custom Error Messages**: Ensure that custom error messages are correctly set up to provide clear guidance on validation failures.

### 3. Use Postman for Testing

- **Create and Save Requests**: Use Postman to create, save, and organize requests for each API endpoint.
- **Run Tests**: Execute requests and review responses to ensure that endpoints behave as expected.

### 4. Handle Exceptions

- **Try-Catch Blocks**: Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error responses.
- **ModelNotFoundException**: Specifically handle `ModelNotFoundException` to return a `404 Not Found` response when a student record does not exist.

<h2>Installation</h2>

- **IDE**: An integrated development environment(IDE) makes development easier [official website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- **Visual Studio**: A powerful IDE for Windows and MacOS, which provides extensive feature for C# development.

# Architechture
<h2>StudentController.ts</h2>

Manages student records with methods to create (`store`), read(`show`), update (`update`), delete (`destroy`), and validate inputs, ensuring robust and secure CRUD operations.

<h2>Routes.ts</h2>

Maps HTTP methods to `StudentsController` actions, defining `endpoints` for creating, reading, updating, and deleting student records, ensuring structured API interaction.

# Postman(CRUD)

<h2>API Endpoint</h2>

**You can interact with the Student Management API using the following base URL**:

 ```http://127.0.0.1:3333/api/v1/students```
 
<h2>GET Student</h2>
 
Use the `GET` method to retrieve student details by ID or All of the lists.

* ### Result in Postman [Click here](https://github.com/ChungmanPARK12/API/tree/1f24ce91800993c18cc13a1f5f84533a348935ae/src/GetAllStudents)

<h2>POST Student</h2>
 
Use the `Update` method to create a new student record by sending student details in the request body.

* ### Result in Postman [Click here](https://github.com/ChungmanPARK12/API/tree/1f24ce91800993c18cc13a1f5f84533a348935ae/src/ResultOfPost)

<h2>DELETE Student</h2>
 
Use the `DELETE` method to remove a student record by providing specific criteria in the request body.

<h2>UPDATE Student</h2>

Use the `PUT` method to update an existing student record by its ID, replacing all fields with new data.


* ### Result in Postman [Click here](https://github.com/ChungmanPARK12/API/tree/b8f2241e0984719436e545670f87dc630cbb0832/src/ResultOfPut)

Use the `PATCH` method to update specific fields of an existing student record without replacing the entire record.

## Summary

The Student Management API allows for efficient management of student records through CRUD operations. Users can create, read, update, and delete student data using HTTP methods. The API ensures data integrity with validation and secure endpoints. Postman is used for testing and documentation, providing a reliable interface for interacting with the API.
